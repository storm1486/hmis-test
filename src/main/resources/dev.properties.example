# These are default Google credentials which will work with localhost on
# ports 8000, 3000, 8080, and 8888 (using either http or https) to
# identify users with OAuth.  The client ID and secret were created in
# the Google API Console
# (https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/library?pli=1)
# as described here:
# https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/server-side-flow.

# If you are just doing local development or testing, you can probably
# use these default credentials.  If you are deploying a production
# instance, you'll need to get new dedicated credentials for it; see
# the "Manage OAuth authentication" section in INSTALL.md for more.
